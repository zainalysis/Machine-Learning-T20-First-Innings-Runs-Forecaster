# T20 First Innings Total Runs Predictor

## Overview

This project is a Streamlit application designed to predict the total runs scored in the first innings of T20 cricket matches. Utilizing a trained machine learning model, this app provides users with an interactive interface to input key parameters and receive predicted run totals.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit, allowing for easy interaction.
- **Model Prediction**: Predicts first innings runs based on historical data and key input features.
- **Visualizations**: Displays relevant insights and trends.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/t20-first-innings-total-runs-predictor.git
   cd t20-first-innings-total-runs-predictor
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Input the required parameters and click on the predict button to get the total runs prediction.

## Model

The model used for prediction is built using scikit-learn and xgboost. It leverages historical T20 match data to forecast the first innings total runs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- xgboost

You can install all the required packages by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
